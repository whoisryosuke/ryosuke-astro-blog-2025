## Notes

### Content

Blogs and projects written as MDX files and are stored in the [content folder](./src/content). Blogs are separated by the year of publication as folders. You can find all this, and the data structure defined in the [Astro content configuration file](./src/content.config.ts).

For other types of static content, like resources, they're stored in `src/data/`.

## Licensing

The code is open source and unlicensed. You are not permitted to use any of the art or writing, or the styling of the website _(basically don't copy my site)_.
