I’ve been doing a bit of [motion graphics and animation](https://bsky.app/hashtag/b3d?author=whoisryosuke.bsky.social) in **Blender** recently. It’s a fun open source alternative to more closed source options like **After Effects**, **Rive**, or **Cavalry**. But I will say, Blender is made from the perspective of it being a 3D app primarily. Common features that are present in more modern design and animation apps haven’t found their way into the Blender workflow yet.

One of the these features Blender is lacking is **design tokens**. I use them all the time in **Figma** and code to create a cohesive design system that’s easy to use for the designer or developer. But Blender doesn’t really have the concept of tokens, or even saving colors for reuse easily.

Which is why I’ve made a plugin for Blender to bring design tokens to the platform. You can create color tokens in the plugin - or import tokens from another app using JSON. Then you can use these tokens in your shaders, or even geometry nodes.

You can download the [plugin here](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/blender-design-token-manager) or check out the source code.
