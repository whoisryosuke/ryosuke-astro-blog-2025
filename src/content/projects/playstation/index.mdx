All of my work at PlayStation was completed at one of the highest clearance levels possible, meaning it’s all under **NDA**. I couldn't show anything without revealing some degree of company secrets - the beauty of working with devkits and internal hardware.

I had the privilege of contributing to most of the platforms at PlayStation, from their consoles (**PS4**, **PS5**), mobile devices (**PS App**), AR/VR (**PSVR2**) desktop applications, and other in-house native platforms (**PS Portal**). As well as working with the developer platform (**PS Partners**) and various partners like Unreal and Unity. My last project was supporting the development of future unreleased hardware.

My work involved prototyping applications for discovery or UX research, to creating tools and documentation for internal developers and designers. I touched every part of of the platform: from all the different internal and backend services, to the low level graphics rendering layer of each device.

I won several awards for my side projects. Notably I created an application to design directly on the PS5 devkits using a drag and drop React application. I was able to integrate internal devkit cloud systems to allow designers to provision PS5s virtually and take screenshots remotely.
